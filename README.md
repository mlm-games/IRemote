> The UI is mostly TV oriented, certain features that are not possible to be executed in minimal way (like extraction notifications not being possible on TV) are not present.

A fast, modern file manager with powerful archive support and an Android TV–friendly UI.

## Features
- File browsing: internal storage or any SAF folder
- Archives: create ZIP/7z; extract ZIP, 7z, TAR, TGZ, TBZ2, TXZ, APK/JAR
- Encrypted archives: ZIP (AES) and 7z
- Open archives as folders; extract selected paths
- Background tasks (slightly unreliable, can't request for always on bg permission on TV)
- Android TV layout, focus rings, and large targets
- Compose UI, Material 3

## Downloads

## Permissions
